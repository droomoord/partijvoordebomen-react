This is a website I made for a local political party. You can visit it at http://www.partijvoordebomenoptexel.nl <br />

The front-end is made with React and hosted on Netflify. Any change to this repo will create a new Deploy on Netlify. <br />

An admin can log in to the website, and change the website's content. It then makes requests to an API that I made, that is hosted somewhere else. The API only takes requests from http://www.partijvoordebomenoptexel.nl.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
